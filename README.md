## About the Project

Thank you for visiting this repository 👋  

**BMI Calculator** is a Flutter mobile application created to demonstrate my skills in **Flutter development**, **UI building**, and **basic application logic**.

The application allows users to calculate their **Body Mass Index (BMI)** by entering their height and weight.  
The project focuses on clean UI, proper widget hierarchy, and simple mathematical logic implemented using Flutter.
